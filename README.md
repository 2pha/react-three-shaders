Just an experiment with react, three.js and shaders. This is my first time using react.

View the build [HERE](https://2pha.github.io/react-three-shaders/build/)

It implements some of the shaders from [this blog post](https://2pha.com/blog/experimenting-threejs-shaders-and-shadermaterial/) in a react app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
